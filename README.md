Rowdy has pecked his way into SM64!
Made by: A_Bunny

Special thanks to:
Squishy6094: Character Select mod
srGSR: Custom Move Set mod
MiniSkippy: Textures, Emotional Support, and Friend 

Install:
Put Character Select and Easy Custom Moveset into your mods folder, then put [CS] Rowdy the riverhawk into mods folder. 
In the Easy Custom Moveset Mod initial-characterstats-table.lua, add the following lines of code at the bottom:

{-- character that can do ground pound jump and ground pound dive
    name = 'Rowdy the Riverhawk',
    ground_pound_antecipation_speed_up = 'medium',
    ground_pound_jump_on = true,
    wall_slide_on = true,
    ground_pound_jump_forward_vel = 20,
    ground_pound_dive_on = true,
    glide_dive_on = true,
    ground_pound_jump_dive_on = true,
    moveset_description = "With the power of wings, you can glide by holding 'B' and preform a ground pound jump!" 
}

Turn on all three mods in SM64CoopDX and you're all set!
